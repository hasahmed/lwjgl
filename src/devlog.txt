CURRENTLY:
    Just finished seperating shape logic from rendering logic, no arbitrary squares can be added without problem.

    To do: Coninue cleanup.
        add ability to move shapes and stuff.
        Have way to handle input
        Have way to change background color
        Make a general method to generate rectangles instead of just squares.
        Make a method to generate other shapes too.
        Colision detection
        GL code executed on seperate thread
        Callbacks for various things
        Consider Hiarchial node structure like godot.



NOTE***************** THE RUN CONFIGURATION THAT CURRENTLY SAYS "BUILD ARTIFACTS" DOES NOT ACTUALLY BUILD THE ARTIFACTS.
IN ORDER FOR IT TO DO SO, THE ARTIFCACT THINGY MUST BE SELECTED, THEN THE PENCIL CLICKED, AND THE CHECK MARK PRESSED!!!
