Have been working on general cleanup. Most recent development making the GLUtil class constructor take the window width
and height as arguments so that it could generate squares with the correct aspect ratio.

Future plans: Continue cleanup. Seperate GLHandler class from drawing of the current random objects.


NOTE***************** THE RUN CONFIGURATION THAT CURRENTLY SAYS "BUILD ARTIFACTS" DOES NOT ACTUALLY BUILD THE ARTIFACTS.
IN ORDER FOR IT TO DO SO, THE ARTIFCACT THINGY MUST BE SELECTED, THEN THE PENCIL CLICKED, AND THE CHECK MARK PRESSED!!!
